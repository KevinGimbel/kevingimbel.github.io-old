    <p>As part of my day to day life as Front-End Developer it's my job to assure that our clients websites fit on all screens. To ensure this, I test them with real devices and various browsers. One of the most used is the amazing and simple <a href="http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/">Viewport Resizer</a> by Malte Wassermann.</p>

  <p>As IT Assistant I spent most of my time working with Servers and learning how they work, how to safe data responsively (e.g. by using RAID-Systems and combinations of different RAIDs) and most importantley I learned to work in an English speaking enviorment - which was pretty awesome at the time.</p>

  <h3>Skills</h3>
</div>

  <div class="card-content">
    <h4>Programming</h4>
    <p class="card-meta">Talking about my skills is none of my skills</p>
    <p>I've been doing <u>HTML and CSS since around 2009</u> which marks a good part of my life. I
    enjoy digging into Code and reading other peoples Source Code. Unfortunately I avoided <u>JavaScript</u> for a long time and started really getting into it around <u>February 2014</u> - since then I fell in love with it.</p>
  <p>I'm also working with PHP daily (Magento; WordPress) but more on the Front-End side by creating
  and updating templates and themes.</p>
  <p>For an upcoming Project I started getting into ReactJS and NodeJS more to create a server-side
  rendered, full-stack JavaScript App. I enjoy JavaScript a lot and ReactJS is my V in MVC of
  choice.</p>

  <div class="card-content">
    <h4>Languages</h4>
    <p class="card-meta">German (native), English (fluent)</p>
    <p>Because I was born and raised in Germany I speak German, even though I enjoy speaking and writing english more. I also prefere to watch TV shows (such as Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad) in English. Due to the fact most of the (web) development world is English I also write and tweet in English to increase my reach.</p>
