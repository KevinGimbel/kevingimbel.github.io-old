Responsible for the content of this site: [Kevin Gimbel](/about/).

Message me at hallo@thissite or hit me up on [Twitter @_kevinatari](https://twitter.com/_kevinatari). if you need to get in contact.

### Technology

This site is build with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/), [Nick Quaranto](http://quaran.to/) and many more [awesome contributors](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/graphs/contributors).

### Copyright

This site is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/kevingimbel/kevingimbel.github.io), the source code is free to see and free to use. However, all content is **not** free to re-use, that is everything inside the `_posts` folder, `de` folder and every other content page. Scripts published are free to use if not stated otherwise. If there comes a LICENSE file with the repository that license is to be used. Otherwise, everything is released as "DO WHAT YOU WANT" and comes without any warranty.

### Tracking

This site is using self-hosted [Piwik analytics](http://piwik.org/) to track
views. The data is not shared with anyone expect me. I use it to see where
traffic comes from and which pages generate the most traffic. Tracking can suck,
I know that, and this is why I want to be as transparent as possible. So below
is a sample of what Piwik records. Piwik by default respects the "Do Not Track"
settings and I kept this feature on. If you decided to opt-out of general
tracking, Piwik will not record anything! See more about Do Not Track [on
donottrack.us](http://donottrack.us)

Lets say you visit this site (as you do, just now). Piwik will then tell me the following things about you: Your Location (Country), Your Operating System (Windows, iOS, Android, Linux, etc.) Your Browser and Browser Version, Your Resolution (e.g. 1920x1080), average page load speed, first and last visit date, time spent on my website, links visited, from where you entered the site, e.g. "Direct Entry" or Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and so on.


This data is then used to see where my readers (that's you!) come from and what technology they use. For example, this website hast almost 0 Traffic from Internet Explorer below 9 - that means I don't need to spent a lot of my free time debugging and fixing things for IE < 9. As said earlier, I am not publishing this data and it is hosted on one of my servers with a German Hosting Provider. All data is anonymous, means I do not see any private data, e.g. if you're logged in to your Facebook, Google or Twitter or what so ever nor do I see your name or anything related to that. The data collected is merely "meta data" - which of course is also kinda sensitive depending on the Context - but I do my best to keep it save and private to me. Nobody else has access to the Piwik Dashboard and I am the only person looking at the data.

I might publish some bundled data, like Browser Versions or something like that.

### Software
