About 1 year ago I joined a [tlk.io](http://tlk.io/codepen) Chat created by [Tim Pietrusky](http://twitter.com/timpietrusky). It was my first time ever I joined a group of other devs and I was more then nervouse about because I - at this time - considered my self more of a Hobby-Dev who's not that skilled. I just started using CodePen a few months before and did some fun demos and experiments there like drawing images with CSS and stuff. However, through [We Love Icon Fonts](http://weloveiconfonts.com) and Twitter I got to know Tim a bit more and as time passed we - and the others - talked daily in our dev chat. It felt super awesome to be around skilled people and I really enjoyed their company.

As I found out that Tim lives near me I wanted to meet him because the only person I ever knew who did web-stuff was my best friend [Max](http://twitter.com/MyXoToD) so we drove to Tim's, had some self-made burgers and worked a bit together. That was about 5 months ago and just on Friday I broke up School to work as a full-time Front-End Developer with Tim at [Synoa](http://synoa.de). I'm really excited about this! 

Tim always said I'd be skilled and he'd be sure I could create amazing things and I can be - and am willing to - become an awesome web developer. In fact, Tim trusts more in me then I do. Thanks for this at this point. 
So, he got me into a Company and wanted to work with me, I accepted and on January 1th 2014 I'll officially start working there. [CodePen](http://codepen.io) played a big role in getting me this Job because it's an easy way to show off your skills and an even more easy way to build a Portfolio full of snippets. It took me a lot of time to do different things and while my friends where outside drinking on the weekends I was home doing [a CSS classic Gameboy](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/vtJzn), a [Vault-Tec Logo](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/IsBka), the [Aperture Science Logo](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/wAljf), a [turret from Portal](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/jGFCs), [R2D2](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/BpcGr) or a single element [Link from The Legend Of Zelda](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/iqDIv) - those things are all useless but fun and they helped me a lot in understanding CSS and Sass. I did this to have fun and to have things I could show to others and as I know now it was worth it. I've got a Job offer and I'll work at a company again.

Getting to know [Tim](http://twitter.com/timpietrusky), using [CodePen](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel) that much and [joining a dev group](/join-a-dev-group) have been the best decisions I made this year. I am happy and I'm looking forward to a full-time working year with a lot of awesome client projects.
