Recently I decided to redesign and redefine my online appearance and the way I publish content to the internet. I switched from using 2 domains as Blog and Portfolio to one new Domain for both: *kevingimbel.com*

This page is build with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) a blog-aware static site generator you're going to love. I wrote a [Guide to get started](/jekyll-guide/) - so if you consider doing so give it a look.

Beside switching to a new domain I also switched my hoster. This page is [hosted at GitHub](https://github.com/kevingimbel/kevingimbel.github.io) and my domain(s) and everything else will be moved to [Uberspace.de](http://uberspace.de) an amazing hosting service from Germany.

Another point on the list is to write more posts about web related stuff. I think it's interesting to get a deeper look into the technique or idea of some CodePen experiments, new Technologies (such as [CSS4's Drag Pseudo Class Draft](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors4/#drag-pseudos)) and much more. 

If you'd like to have a tutorial for any of my [CodePens](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel) simply [tweet me](http://twitter.com/_kevinatari) the Link to it.
