I decided to write a general license for stuff I publish so everything is clear. I also thought about future use of my work because the license is very open. So, the license model I decided to use is: "date-based" licenses. This means if I decide to publish things for free with out a need to name me now you can use my work, if I change the license later the new license only applies to work published **after** the license has been created. Below you find the name and spec of the current license and the date it was published. 

*Notice:* The date format is MM/DD/YY.

### Open License

| Date | Applies For |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  10/05/13 | Every piece of code and work created *before and after* October 5th 2013 if no other license model is given.|

The *Open License* licenses all my work under the following aspects.

"Work" means CodePen Snippets, Prototypes or Demos and the things I share on GitHub (if no other license is given). 
The license doesn't apply to articles. If you want to use an article you should [contact me](/imprint/).

**The work can:**

- be used free for commercial and private.
- be modified.
- be part of your project
- be used without credits or back linking. Anyway credits are appreciated.


**The work can not be:**

- addressed as own product without modification
- sold as stand-alone to customers
	- this means in particular:
		- no direct sell
		- use *inside* your commercial project is permitted
- be used as give-away
- be used inside a publication to explain it without mentioning me as the creator

If you're still not sure if you can or can't use my work feel free to [contact me](/imprint/)
